            <h1>Community service</h1>
            <h>Sherubste UN</h>
            <p>In a commendable effort to promote health and hygiene among young girls, the Sherubtse United Nations Unit launched a community service initiative focused on providing sanitary pads to female students in the local schools. This initiative addresses a critical need for menstrual health management and aims to empower girls by ensuring they have access to essential hygiene products.

                <br>Objectives of the Initiative
                <br>The primary objectives of this initiative are:
                
                <br>Promote Menstrual Hygiene: Educate girls about menstrual health and hygiene, reducing stigma and misconceptions associated with menstruation.
                <br>Enhance School Attendance: Ensure that girls do not miss school due to lack of access to sanitary products, thereby promoting consistent attendance and participation in educational activities.
                <br>Empower Young Women: Provide girls with the resources they need to feel confident and supported during their menstrual cycles, encouraging their active participation in all school activities.
                <br>Activities Conducted
                <br>The initiative included various activities designed to maximize its impact:
                
                <br>Distribution of Sanitary Pads: The Sherubtse UN Unit organized a distribution drive, providing sanitary pads to female students in partnership with local schools. This ensured that girls had access to necessary hygiene products, promoting their well-being.
                
                <br>Educational Workshops: Workshops were held to educate girls about menstrual health, hygiene practices, and the importance of self-care during their menstrual cycles. These sessions aimed to empower them with knowledge and break the silence surrounding menstruation.
                
                <br>Engagement with Parents and Guardians: The initiative also involved engaging with parents and guardians to create a supportive environment for girls. Informational sessions were held to address concerns and foster open communication about menstrual health.
                
                <br>Feedback Mechanism: To ensure the initiative's effectiveness, a feedback mechanism was implemented, allowing students and teachers to share their experiences and suggestions for improvement.
                
                <br>Impact and Future Plans
                <br>The response from the community has been overwhelmingly positive. Many girls expressed relief and gratitude for the support, noting that the provision of sanitary pads has allowed them to attend school without fear of embarrassment or discomfort. Teachers reported increased school attendance among female students following the distribution.
                
                <br>The Sherubtse UN Unit is committed to continuing this vital initiative, with plans to expand the program to reach more schools and provide ongoing education on menstrual hygiene. Through this community service effort, the Sherubtse UN Unit is not only addressing immediate needs but also working towards long-term change in attitudes and practices surrounding menstrual health in the community.</p>
